### Track 1: Automatic Annotation of Technical Data for Badminton Match Videos
In this track, participants develop computer vision technology to automatically extract shot-by-shot technical data from the broadcast video of badminton matches. The shot-by-shot data include the temporal, spatial, posture, and skill information as the shuttlecock is hit during the match such as data at the hitting time, ball position, hitting player, swing posture, standing position of both sides, used ball type, and winner. Those are composed of the big data for technical and tactical analysis of badminton matches. The scoring is rally-based, where each rally is evaluated separately and can get up to 1 point in total according to the correctness of the number of shots in the rally and the accuracy of the predicted attributes. The final ranking is sorted from highest to lowest according to the total score, with the highest being the first and the lowest being the last.
